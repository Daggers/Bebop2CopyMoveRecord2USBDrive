There are 5 scripts in this installer. They can be run by pressing the power button of your drone.

Press 5 times: COPY media files from internal memory to USB pendrive.
Press 6 times: MOVE media files from internal memory to USB pendrive.
Press 7 times: DELETE media files from internal memory.
Press 8 times: Change recording location to USB pendrive.
Press 9 times: Change recording location to internal memory.


Scripts start with 4 quieter sounds. This indicates that the script has started.
During the COPY and MOVE function you will also hear 4 sounds every 15 seconds until task is complete.

You get some alarms (beeps and led lights) when task is complete.
Alarm feedback as follows:

- 1: There are no media files in internal memory so there is nothing to COPY/MOVE!
- 2: All done without errors.
- 5: Something went wrong. For troubleshoot see below: 
In 3 press: Is pendrive mounted?, Is recording location set to internal memory? (9 press)
In 5 press: Is pendrive mounted?, Is recording location set to internal memory? (9 press)
In 6 press: You did NOT copy your files earlier using 3 press!
In 8 press: Is pendrive mounted?, Is media folder in internal memory empty?
In 9 press: You shouldn't get any error here.
